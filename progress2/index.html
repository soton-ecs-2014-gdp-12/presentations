			<h1>Why?</h1><!-- Chris B -->
			<ul>
				<li>A new version of Synote is planned</li>
				<li>New opportunities for Synote
				<ul>
					<li>After lecture review</li>
					<li>Live in Lectures</li>
					<li>MOOC's</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<aside class="notes">
				This project is in preperation for the upcoming rewrite of Synote.
				The next version of Synote is planned to use AngularJS, so we are
				implementing the core functionality as a plugin to an existing project
				that provides an AngularJS wrapper around HTML5 videos.

				Adding quizes in to videos could provide an innovitive way to revise
				content from a lecture. If the user gives the incorrect answer, it can
				suggest to skip back to the relevant part of the video, avoiding the
				user rewatching the video from the start, or hopping around trying to
				find the relevant part. As an aditional learning activity, the students
				could collaberate around Synote to create the quiz content.

				Polls could be used within lectures in a live manor to make the lecture
				more interactive, perhaps asking about understanding, or getting other
				information about the people in the lecture. After the lecture, the
				polls could continue, such that those not at the lecutre could interact
				in a similar manor, or the poll could become static and just show the
				results from the lecture.

				Both of these examples would fit in well to a MOOC's, which Synote
				could be used to provide.
